In addition to voluntary benefits, employers are also required by law to provide certain benefits to their employees. These benefits can provide financial support during difficult times and help protect your well-being.

In this chapter, we'll explore some of the essential legal benefits you may be entitled to as an employee.

Workers' Compensation
---------------------

Workers' compensation is a type of insurance that provides benefits to employees who are injured on the job or become ill due to work-related conditions. These benefits may include medical expenses, lost wages, and disability payments.

If you're injured at work or develop a work-related illness, it's essential to report the incident to your employer as soon as possible. Your employer should provide you with the necessary paperwork to file a workers' compensation claim.

Disability Insurance
--------------------

Disability insurance is another crucial legal benefit that provides financial support if you become disabled and unable to work. This insurance may be provided by your employer or purchased on your own.

There are two types of disability insurance: short-term and long-term. Short-term disability insurance typically provides coverage for up to six months, while long-term disability insurance can provide coverage for years or even until retirement age.

Employee Assistance Programs
----------------------------

Employee assistance programs (EAPs) are another legal benefit that can provide employees with support during difficult times. EAPs offer confidential counseling services and other resources to help employees deal with personal or work-related issues like stress, addiction, or grief.

Many employers offer EAPs as part of their benefits package, and these programs are often free to employees. If you're struggling with personal or work-related issues, consider reaching out to your employer's EAP for support.

Conclusion
----------

Legal benefits like workers' compensation, disability insurance, and employee assistance programs can provide critical support during challenging times. It's essential to understand your rights and entitlements under these programs and take advantage of them if needed.

By educating yourself on these legal benefits, you can better protect your well-being and financial security. If you have questions about your entitlements or coverage, speak to your employer's HR department or a qualified professional for guidance.
