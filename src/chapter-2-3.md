# Key Terminology

Understanding workplace benefits can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to the terminology. In this chapter, we'll define some of the essential terms you need to know to make informed decisions about your benefits.

Deductible
----------

A deductible is the amount you pay for covered healthcare services before your insurance plan starts paying. For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible and have a medical bill of $5,000, you'll need to pay the first $1,000, and your insurance will cover the remaining $4,000.

Coinsurance
-----------

Coinsurance is the percentage of health care costs you're responsible for paying after meeting your deductible. For instance, if your coinsurance is 20%, you'll pay 20% of the cost of covered services, and your insurance will pay the remaining 80%.

Copayment
---------

A copayment is a fixed amount you pay for a covered service, such as a doctor's visit or prescription medication. For example, if your copayment for a primary care visit is $20, you'll pay $20 at each visit, and your insurance will cover the rest.

Out-of-pocket maximum
---------------------

The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you'll have to pay for covered healthcare services in a year. Once you reach this limit, your insurance will cover all eligible expenses for the remainder of the year.

Premium
-------

A premium is the amount you pay each month for your insurance coverage. This amount is usually deducted from your paycheck if you receive insurance through your employer.

FSA/HSA
-------

A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and Health Savings Account (HSA) are both accounts you can use to save money on healthcare expenses. An FSA is funded with pre-tax dollars and must be used by the end of the year, while an HSA is also funded with pre-tax dollars but can be carried over from year to year.

401k
----

A 401k is a retirement savings plan offered by some employers. You can contribute a portion of your pre-tax income to the plan, and your employer may also contribute. The money in your 401k grows tax-free until you withdraw it in retirement.

Pension
-------

A pension is a retirement plan that provides a fixed monthly payment to retirees based on their years of service and salary. Pensions are less common than they used to be, but some employers still offer them.

Conclusion
----------

Understanding key terminology related to workplace benefits is essential to making informed decisions about your coverage. By knowing what terms like deductible, coinsurance, copayment, out-of-pocket maximum, premium, FSA/HSA, 401k, and pension mean, you'll be better equipped to select the benefits that best meet your needs.
