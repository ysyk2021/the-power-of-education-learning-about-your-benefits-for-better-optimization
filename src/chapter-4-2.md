To leverage stock options effectively, organizations should:

* Offer clear terms: Organizations should offer clear terms around stock options, including eligibility criteria, vesting schedules, and any limitations or restrictions.
* Communicate the benefit: Leaders should communicate the availability of stock options to all employees, highlighting its importance and potential benefits.
